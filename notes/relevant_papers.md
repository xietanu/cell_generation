- Perspective Transformer Nets: Learning Single-View 3D Object Reconstruction without 3D Supervision
    - Very relevant, similar base problem. 
- Efficient Geometry-aware 3D Generative Adversarial Networks, deriving 3D mesh from multiple 2D images
    - Potentially some overlap - requires a base 3D model to work from, however.
- pixelNeRF: Neural Radiance Fields from One or Few Images
- Learning Generative Models of Textured 3D Meshes from Real-World Images
